# usage 
yea there is this variable path that is the full path to your winecraft world

also you need "amulet-core" installed

also also the gcode has to be called model.gcode but its easy to change

also also also also i couldnt figure out how to reset a mc world completely so i just rm -r "path" the region files so watch out it might delet important stuff

also x whatever the parser only looks at marlin flavour and only g1 instructions
